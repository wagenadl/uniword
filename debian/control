Description: Keyword-based unicode character selector
 Entering unicode characters that do not visually appear on your
 keyboard can be tricky. With Uniword, you can find unicode characters
 by typing a few keywords. For instance, if you type "degree", Uniword
 will offer "¬∞ ‚ÑÉ ‚Ñâ ùÜ©" for your further selection. Uniword recognizes
 all keywords that occur in the Unicode Consortium's "UnicodeData.txt"
 and "Index.txt" files.
